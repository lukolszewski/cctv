My version forked from https://github.com/TheJosh/cctv 

I have added features I want. They are:
- ability to select cameras and modify them after original creation, this has a feel most people including myself are accustomed to
- ability to name cameras and have a notes field. These are only visible on the right not to clutter the map
- ability to copy camera specs from another (so you don't have to set the same many times)
- ability to save and load your project.
- ability to reposition cameras.

Here is the demo
